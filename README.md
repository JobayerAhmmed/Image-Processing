# Image Processing

Several image processing and pattern recognition algorithms are implemented here in Java. 
Moreover, Bengali character seperation from text images, and male and female feature extraction and detection 
are two interesting works.

- Sobel Edge Detection
- Hough Transform for Line Detection
- Harris Corner Detection
- Skin Detection
- K-Means Clustering
- Mean-Shift Clustering
- Red Eye Detection and Removing
- Image Convertion to GrayScale
- Image Convertion to Binary
- Image Convertion to Negative
- Bengali characters separation from text image
- Image Feature Extraction and Male Female Detection
